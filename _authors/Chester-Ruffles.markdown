$$\TeX_2$$ hard is my alias when it comes to playing smash and writing up latex reports.  Here are some of the most essential and favorite Latex packages.  
> We loved with a love that was more than love


### Essential
-**Graphicx** An absolute must have to deploy figures and pictures.

-**siunitx** This is a really nice package to properly do units (no you cannot raise to the power of o for degrees).


-**physics** Really, how could it be anything else?  Many people often go straight for the ams package, but the physics package just feels a little more intuitive and has slightly prettier paranthesis (imo).  

-**tikz** I hear you already shouting BASIC!!!! but wait.  Not just any tikz, but <code>\usepackage{tikzlings-bears}</code>
you can now draw bears and cats.


-**booktabs** A must have for nice-looking tables.

-**caption** A very powerful package that makes your captions and figures look more professional.

-**hyperref** Allows you to have references hyperlink.  Especially given the rise in pdf textbooks, this is a must have and a life saver.  Also useful for those who are writing a thesis...hint hint.

-**Geometry** Duh.

### Favorite
-**Fouriernc** This allows you to use the New-Century Schoolbook font, which really is an excellent choice.  

-**bclogo**
Ah yes, bclogo.  This is the best table and box package in the game, hands down.  Unfortunately, the documentation is in French, but luckily, tex2hard took 5 years of French in his highschool and middle school days.  

-**csquotes** This package is essentual for quoting things and international support for things like French quotes. 


-**placeins** These are essential for enforcing even semi-sane float behavior. 

-**fancyhdr** Allows the user to have nice footer and headers really easily.

### Smash


Now, lets transition to smash.  Despite the name, $$\TeX_2$$ hard was always a pretty lousy player, save for the occasional tech.  However, here is $$\TeX_2$$hard's favorite smash moment.  Look here at 28:32
