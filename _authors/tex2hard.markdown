$$\TeX_2$$ hard is my alias when it comes to playing smash and writing up latex reports.  Here are some of my favorite Latex packages.  

- **Fouriernc** This allows you to use the New-Century Schoolbook font, which really is an excellent choice.  
<hr>
-**bclogo**
Ah yes, bclogo.  This is the best table and box package in the game, hands down.  Unfortunately, the documentation is in French, but luckily, tex2hard took 5 years of French in his highschool and middle school days.  

-**physics** Really, how could it be anything else?  Many people often go straight for the ams package, but the physics package just feels a little more intuitive and has slightly prettier paranthesis (imo).  


-**tikz** I hear you already shouting BASIC!!!! but wait.  Not just any tikz, but <code>\usepackage{tikzlings-bears}</code>
you can now draw bears and cats.


Now, lets transition to smash.  Despite the name, $$\TeX_2$$ hard was always a pretty lousy player, save for the occasional tech.
