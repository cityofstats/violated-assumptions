##FIRST BLOG##
This is the first blog post.  No particular topic.

*R Code*
```{r, background-color: #edf6ff;}
a=c(1,2,3)
b=c(-1,-2,-3)
print(sum(a+b))
```

<h3>Some goals of the blog <code>.default</code> </h3>
<ul class="default">
  <li> Share some (basic) R/Python code.  Hopefully this can be explanatory, as my coding is rather poor.  Granted, that could also backfire.</li>
  <li> Share new stuff we're learning, particuarly as it pertains to learning more lower level programming.</li>
  <li>Stay sane during the quarantine.</li>
</ul>
