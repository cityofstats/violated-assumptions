## Examining Different Statistical Softwares

Hello, friends.  Today, we will take a deep dive into the world of statistical softwares.  Software has become a necessity for statisticians, and 

## The Free and Open Source

# Python
Python is now generally regarded as one of the two must-know languages for the modern data scientist.  A powerful high level programming language, Python is popular amongst many different professions.  It reads like english.  Its got a huge online support system.  There are thousands, if not millions of packages.  It has (essentially) sub-languages that allow it to mimic statistical software such as R, and allow for complicated machine learning algorithms to be used pretty easily.  It's a language that introductory students don't fear, and top level programmers (sometimes) love.  You can interface with lower level languages, such as C. Finally, new plugins such as DASH allow for cool web applications to be made relatively easily. With all these features, python seems like an easy choice for the young statistician.  But, there are some flaws.

Like all high level languages, python suffers from speed issues.  One thing you sacrifice with readability is how long everything takes.  For example, C can be up to 100 times faster than python, and for some complicated simulations (like weather modeling), running code in python will crash your server.  But, it would be much easier to write and easier to explain to new hires/students who want to tamper/edit/expand on the code.
