##Hello
Hello friends
Been a while.  Today's blog is a simple update on my life.  Recently I was twirling my keys on my lanyard while walking to cvs.  Unfortunately, and unwittingly, I twirled my key off on the walk and thought it was lost.  After quite a bit of soul searching, as well as physical searching, I found the key alongside my roommate next to a bush off a sidewalk.  All was right with the world.  

Or was it?  Man, we found so much littering in our search for the key.  Just so many empty miniature liquor bottles were plastered everywhere.  Gross.  Those are RECYCLABLE!  Well, at least I found the solution.  
##FLEX TAPE
No unfortunately, flex tape did not work.  However, I did transition from the lanyard to a smaller keychain with a small band that was supplied by my old apartment complex.  It was always pretty nice but  I never used it because I thought I was a lanyard guy and all other keychains were just nice trinkets.  Oh, how wrong I was.  How wrong I was...
