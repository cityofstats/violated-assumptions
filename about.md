Violated Assumptions is a blog ran by graduate students in mathematics and statistics at Arizona State University.  Join us as we delve into the most cutting edge and impactful statistical research, complain about other math/statistics research, and share our favorite baking recipes and moments from the Harry Potter saga.  This will be quite the ride, and we are glad to have you with us!


This blog is made from the Centrarium, a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/). And you can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
